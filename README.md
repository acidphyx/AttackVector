# AttackVector Information and Original Purpose

Attack Vector is/was a program created to more easily facilitate many aspects of Wireless and SSL Hacking. Originally v1.0 Designed for use with the Pentesting O/S, BackTrack 3.

v1.1 was updated to work correctly with BackTrack 4, with some added functionality.

# Current Status

I stopped developing the code when my children were born during v1.5 which was intened to work with BackTrack 5. I know that most functions worked but not all. 

At the moment there is not current development on this project. Anyone is free to use this Under the GNU/GPL v2.0
If you have any questions about it's design or operation please do not hesitate to contact me @
